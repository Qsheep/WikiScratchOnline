# Welcome to Chang's WikiScratch

Welcome to my personal 'WikiScratch,' dedicated to documenting engaging topics in data science and machine learning (ML). This webpage serves as my personal repository, and I hope it proves valuable to others as well. Most algorithms are constructed from fundamental mathematical principles and linear algebra, providing insights into the underlying processes.

## [ML basics](mlBasics.md)

While readily available packages exist for most cases, like Principal Component Analysis, I find it more intriguing to implement these algorithms from scratch.

## [Data Visualisation](dataVisualisation.md)

Given the positive feedback on my data visualization skills from peers and colleagues, I will showcase some of my visualizations and explain the techniques behind them.

## [Statistical Tests](statisticalTests.md)

This section covers both mathematical calculations and the visualization of results.

## [Deep Learning](deepLearning.md)

Explore various entertaining deep learning applications, such as neural style transfer, which captivate my interest. Before a full understanding is achieved, these fun examples will be duplicated here as part of my to-study list.
